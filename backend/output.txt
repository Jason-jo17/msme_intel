INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of supabase to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 5) and httpx==0.25.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested httpx==0.25.1
    supabase 2.0.0 depends on httpx<0.25.0 and >=0.24.0

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    httpx

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
